## TEAM NUMBER-09 - FeedBack APP

This project belongs to the Team 9 of hackathon . The project is on a feedback system that incorporates the feedback of students on teachers on a scale of 0 to 10. 
### Project Overview
----------------------------------
* What problem did the team try to solve:
  We were given the problem to solve "FeedBack of Teachers from the Students". 
       
* What is the proposed solution
 It was mainly built to be an enhanced version of the current model deployed to take             feedback from students. We wanted the app to provide a better and precise way to provide feedback that is useful by the faculty.

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
This app creates an easier way to report the feedback to the faculty. The app gives students flexibility in giving feedback by introducing the numerical feedback system with a range of 10.
This gives the user an opportunity to provide feedback that is directly correlated to the efforts to the teacher rather than providing options for predefined feedback.
