The participants are required to fork this repository and create a public Github repository under their own username (Single repository per team). The following created sections in this README.md need to be duly filled, highlighting the denoted points for the solution/implementation. Please feel free to create further sub-sections in this markdown, the idea is to understand the gist of the components in a singular document.

### Project Overview
----------------------------------
* What problem did the team try to solve:
       We were given the problem to solve "FeedBack of Teachers from the Students". 
       
* What is the proposed solution
The was majorly built to as an enhanced version of the current model deployed to take feedback from students. We wanted the the app to provide a better and precise way to provide feedback that is useful by the faculty.

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
This app creates an easier way to report the feedback to the faculty. The app gives students flexibility in giving feedback by introducing the numerical feedback system with a range of 10.
This gives the user an opportunity to provide feedback that is directly correlated to the efforts to the teacher rather than providing options for predefined feedback.
